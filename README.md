# raindrop-bookmarks-converter
 A simple Python script to convert Raindrop export file (Netscape bookmark file) to a readable HTML table.



### Motivation

- I am using [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) as a bookmarking service. The tool is great but I want to have a copy of saved items offline. 
- The export html file is not very readable, so I decided to write a script to turn the export file into a nice table with clear tags, date saved/updated, title, notes and URL for each saved item.



### Further improvements

- [ ] Executable script accessible from the Terminal
- [ ] Separate tags onto individual items
- [ ] Header: name, date saved, date range, number of tags and items
- [ ] Compatibility with Pocket
- [ ] Output table styling
