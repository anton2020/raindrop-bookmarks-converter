# raindrop-bookmarks-converter
 A simple Python script to convert Raindrop export file (Netscape bookmark file) to a readable HTML table.



### Motivation

- I am using [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) as a bookmarking service. The tool is great but I want to have a copy of saved items offline. 
- The export html file is not very readable, so I decided to write a script to turn the export file into a nice table with clear tags, date saved/updated, title, notes and URL for each saved item.



### How to use it

1. Download the script
2. Put the Raindrop export HTML file in the same directory as the script
3. Make sure the export file is called "Raindrop.io.html" (default export name)
4. The output HTML table will be generated under the name of "output_table.html" in the same directory
